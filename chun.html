        <h2>Valentine's day 2020</h2>
        <p>This might look bad, dah lama ga coding html, also kelihatannya I'm really not good at graphic design, too...</p>
        <p>Happy Valentine's day ya chun hehe. Dillan benernya kepengen kasih note yang tertulis ke chun tapi kayak, keliatannya kalo online juga seru deh hehe.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry I can't give too much, soalnya Dillan juga bingung mau kasih apaan. Dillan beliin pan-pan soalnya chun kan suka banget sama panda.</p>
        <p>I really don't know what else to say benernya hehe...</p>
        <p>From the moment I knew you, I think you've grown a lot in me. I don't think I can ever find someone like you as a partner...</p>
        <p>I feel that you've been very kind and forgiving to all my family members even if they are not warranted. I am constantly amazed by how much of a selfless person you are.</p>
        <p>I think that you enable me to have the potential of growing, I hope you would want to grow together too.</p>
        <p>I hope that this letter finds you well, hehe. and I hope that this will be the first of many moments we can share together</p>

        <p>Signed, Sealed, Delivered,</p>
        <p>Dillan</p>

        <p>ps: ini sementara aja keliatannya, nanti dillan mikirin cara untuk bikin this thing lebih private, soalnya ini sementara masih somewhat public hahahaha</p>
